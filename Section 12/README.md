## Questions and Solutions

### Q0: Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.
The programs in this chapter are compiled and tested. The programs can be found in the book.

### Q1: Reimplement the `Str` class, but choose an implementation strategy that the class manage the storage itself. For example, you might store an array of `char` and a length. Consider what implications this change in design has for copy control. Also consider the cost of using `Vec`, (e.g., in storage overhead).
The reimplemented `Str` class can be found in [Str.h](./Str.h). The driver program can be found in [q01.cpp](./q01.cpp).
### Q2: Implement the `c_str`, `data`, and `copy` functions.
The implemented functions are added to [Str.h](./Str.h). The driver program can be found in [q02.cpp](./q02.cpp).

### Q3: Define the relational operators for `Str`. In doing so, you will want to know that the `<cstring>` header defines a function called `strcmp`, which compares two character pointers. The function returns a negative integer if the null-terminated character array denoted by the first pointer is less than the second, zero if the two strings are equal, or a positive value if the first string is greater than the second.
The relational operators are added to [Str.h](./Str.h). The driver program can be found in [q03.cpp](./q03.cpp).

### Q4: Define the equality and inequality operators for `Str`.
The equality and inequality operators are added to [Str.h](./Str.h). The driver program can be found in [q04.cpp](./q04.cpp).

### Q5: Implement concatenation for `Str` so as not to rely on conversions from `const char*`.
Concatenation is added to [Str.h](./Str.h). The driver program can be found in [q05.cpp](./q05.cpp).

### Q6: Give `Str` an operation that will let us implicitly use a `Str` object as a condition. The test should fail if `Str` is empty, and succeed otherwise.

### Q7: The standard `string` class provides random-access iterators to manipulate the `string`'s characters. Add iterators and the iterator operations `begin` and `end` to your `Str` class.

### Q8: Add the `getline` function to the `Str` class.

### Q9: Use class `ostream_iterator` to reimplement the `Str` output operator. Why didn't we ask you to reimplement the input operator using class `input_iterator`?

### Q10: Having seen in ยง12.1/212 how `Str` defined a constructor that takes a pair of iterators, we can imagine that such a constructor would be useful in class `Vec`. Add this constructor to `Vec`, and reimplement `Str` to use the `Vec` constructor instead of calling `copy`.

### Q11: If you add the operations listed in these exercises, then you can use this `Str` class in all the examples in this book. Reimplement the operations on character pictures from Chapter 5 and the `split` functions from ยง5.6/87 and ยง6.1.1/103.

### Q12: Define the `insert` function that takes two iterators for the `Vec` and `Str` classes.

### Q13: Provide an `assign` function that could be used to assign the values in an array to a `Vec`.

### Q14: Write a program to initialize a `Vec` from a `string`.

### Q15: The `read_hw` function from ยง4.1.3/57 checked the stream from which it read to determine whether the function had hit end-of-file, or had encountered an invalid input. Our `Str` input operator does no such check. Why? Will it leave the stream in an invalid state?
