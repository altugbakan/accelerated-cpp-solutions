# Accelerated C++ Solutions
My solutions for the exercises in the book *[Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example](http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/) by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo*.

Solutions for each chapter can be found in their respective folder. The compiler used for these solutions is *[g++ 10.3.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/), built by [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)*. The IDE used is *[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)*.

Note: These are my solutions and they might be incorrect, so use them with caution.
