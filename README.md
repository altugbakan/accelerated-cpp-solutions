# Accelerated C++ Solutions
My solutions for the exercises in the book "Accelerated C++" by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo.

Solutions for each chapter can be found on their respective folder. The compiler used for these solutions is *g++ 10.3.0, built by MSYS2*. The IDE used is *Visual Studio Code*.

Note: These are my solutions and they might be incorrect, so use them with caution.
