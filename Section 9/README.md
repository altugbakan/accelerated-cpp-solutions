## Questions and Solutions

### Q0: Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

### Q1: Reimplement the `Student_info` class so that it calculates the final grade when reading the student's record, and stores that grade in the object. Reimplement the `grade` function to use this precomputed value.

### Q2: If we define the `name` function as a plain, non`const` member function, what other functions in our system must change and why?

### Q3: Our `grade` function was written to throw an exception if a user tried to calculate a grade for a `Student_info` object whose values had not yet been read. Users who care are expected to catch this exception. Write a program that triggers the exception but does not catch it. Write a program that catches the exception.

### Q4: Rewrite your program from the previous exercise to use the `valid` function, thereby avoiding the exception altogether.

### Q5: Write a class and associated functions to generate grades for students who take the course for pass/fail credit. Asuume that only the midterm and final grades matter, and that a student passes with an average exam score greater than 60. The report should list the students in alphabetical order, and indicate `P` or `F` as the grade.

### Q6: Rewrite the grading program for the pass/fail students so that the report shows all the students who passed, followed by all students who failed.

### Q7: The `read_hw` function §4.1.3/57 solves a general problem (reading a sequence of values into a `vector`) even though its name suggests that it should be part of the implementation of `Student_info`. Of course, we could change its name—but suppose, instead, that you wanted to integrate it with the rest of the `Student_info` code, in order to clarify that it was not intended for public access despite its apparent generality? How would you do so?
