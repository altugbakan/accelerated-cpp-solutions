## Questions and Solutions

### Q0: Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.
The programs in this chapter are compiled and tested. The programs can be found in the book.

### Q1: Extend the program from ยง7.2/124 to produce its output sorted by occurence count. That is, the output should group all the words that occur once, followed by those that occur twice, and so on.
The extended program can be found in [q01.cpp](./q01.cpp). After reading and storing the counts of words, the program stores them in a new `map<int, vector<string> >`, in which the keys represent the occurrence count, and the values stored in the `vector` represent the words.

### Q2: Extend the program in ยง4.2.3/64 to assign letter grades by ranges:
<pre>
A 90-100
B 80-89.99...
C 70-79.99...
D 60-69.99...
F <60
</pre>
### The output should list how many students fall into each category.
The extended program can be found in [q02.cpp](./q02.cpp). After reading the grades of the students, the program stores the corresponding student in a `map<string, vector<Student_info> >`, in which the keys represent the letter grades and the values stored in the `vector` represent the students.

### Q3: The cross-reference program from ยง7.3/126 could be improved: As it stands, if a word occurs more than once on the same input line, the program will report that line multiple times. Change the code so that it detects multiple occurences of the same line number and inserts the line number only once.
The program can be found in [q03.cpp](./q03.cpp). Before inserting the `line_number` into the specified word's `vector<int>`, it tries to find if the said number is already included in the `vector<int>` using `find`.

### Q4: The output produced by the cross-reference program will be ungainly if the input file is large. Rewrite the program to break up the output if the lines get too long.
The program can be found in [q04.cpp](./q04.cpp). It breaks up the output after printing 15 line numbers for each row.

### Q5: Reimplement the grammar problem using a `list` as the data structure in which we build the sentence.
The program can be found in [q05.cpp](./q05.cpp). It increments the `const_iterator` in a loop to select a random element from the `list`.

### Q6: Reimplement the `gen_sentence` program using two `vector`s: One will hold the fully unwound, generated sentence, and the other will hold the rules and will be used as a stack. Do not use any recursive calls.
The program can be found in [q06.cpp](./q06.cpp). It puts generated bracketed words in the `rules` vector and the generated words in the `sentence` vector.

### Q7: Change the driver for the cross-reference program so that it writes `line` if there is only one line and `lines` otherwise.
The program can be found in [q07.cpp](./q07.cpp). Using the ternary operator, we can cout `line` or `lines` in their respective conditions.

### Q8: Change the cross-reference program to find all the URLs in a file, and write all the lines on which each distinct URL occurs.
The program can be found in [q08.cpp](./q08.cpp). Using `find_urls` instead of `split` finds all URLs in the provided file.

### Q9: (difficult) The implementation of `nrand` in ยง7.4.4/135 will not work for arguments greater than `RAND_MAX`. Usually, this restriction is no problem, because `RAND_MAX` is often the largest possible integer anyway. Nevertheless, there are implementations under which `RAND_MAX` is much smaller than the largest possible integer. For example, it is not uncommon for `RAND_MAX` to be `32767` (2<sup>15</sup> - 1) and the largest possible integer to be `2147483647` (2<sup>31</sup> - 1). Reimplement `nrand` so that it works well for all values of `n`.
The program can be found in [q09.cpp](./q09.cpp). It first calculates the amount of buckets for numbers larger than `RAND_MAX` and calculates a random number for each bucket. The last bucket will have a random number between `[0, n % RAND_MAX`) and other buckets will have a random number between `[0, RAND_MAX]`.
