## Questions and Solutions

### Q0: Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.
The programs in this chapter are compiled and tested. The programs can be found in the book.

### Q1: Extend the program from ยง7.2/124 to produce its output sorted by occurence count. That is, the output should group all the words that occur once, followed by those that occur twice, and so on.
The extended program can be found in [q01.cpp](./q01.cpp). After reading and storing the counts of words, the program stores them in a new `map<int, vector<string> >`, in which the keys represent the occurrence count, and the values stored in the `vector` represent the words.

### Q2: Extend the program in ยง4.2.3/64 to assign letter grades by ranges:
<pre>
A 90-100
B 80-89.99...
C 70-79.99...
D 60-69.99...
F <60
</pre>
### The output should list how many students fall into each category.
The extended program can be found in [q02.cpp](./q02.cpp). After reading the grades of the students, the program stores the corresponding student in a `map<string, vector<Student_info> >`, in which the keys represent the letter grades and the values stored in the `vector` represent the students.

### Q3: The cross-reference program from ยง7.3/126 could be improved: As it stands, if a word occurs more than once on the same input line, the program will report that line multiple times. Change the code so that it detects multiple occurences of the same line number and inserts the line number only once.

### Q4: The output produced by the cross-reference program will be ungainly if the input file is large. Rewrite the program to break up the output if the lines get too long.

### Q5: Reimplement the grammar problem using a `list` as the data structure in which we build the sentence.

### Q6: Reimplement the `gen_sentence` program using two `vector`s: One will hold the fully unwound, generated sentence, and the other will hold the rules and will be used as a stack. Do not use any recursive calls.

### Q7: Change the driver for the cross-reference program so that it writes `line` if there is only one line and `lines` otherwise.

### Q8: Change the cross-reference program to find all the URLs in a file, and write all the lines on which each distinct URL occurs.

### Q9: (difficult) The implementation of `nrand` in ยง7.4.4/135 will not work for arguments greater than `RAND_MAX`. Usually, this restriction is no problem, because `RAND_MAX` is often the largest possible integer anyway. Nevertheless, there are implementations under which `RAND_MAX` is much smaller than the largest possible integer. For example, it is not uncommon for `RAND_MAX` to be `32767` (2<sup>15</sup> - 1) and the largest possible integer to be `2147483647` (2<sup>31</sup> - 1). Reimplement `nrand` so that it works well for all values of `n`.
