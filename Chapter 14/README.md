## Questions and Solutions

### Q0: Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

### Q1: Implement the comparison operation that operates on `Ptr<Core>`.

### Q2: Implement and test the student grading program using `Ptr<Core>` objects.

### Q3: Implement the `Student_info` class to use the final version of `Ptr`, and use that version to implement the grading program in ยง13.5/247.

### Q4: Reimplement the `Str` class to use the final version of `Ptr`.

### Q5: Test the reimplemented `Str` class by recompiling and rerunning programs that use `Str`, such as the version of `split` and the picture operations that use `Vec<Str>`.

### Q6: The `Ptr` class really solves two problems: maintaining reference counts, and allocating and deallocating objects. Define a class that does reference counting and nothing else; then use that class to implement the `Ptr` class.
